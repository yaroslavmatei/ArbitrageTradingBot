## 🤖 How It Works

This bot scans the prices on multiple DEXs and looks for price differences that allow you to make a profit by swapping SOL between them. It's fast, it's efficient, and it's always looking for opportunities!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Make sure your wallet is funded with **at least 3 SOL**. Otherwise, the bot won't be able to perform any profitable trades.
- Arbitrage can be competitive, so don't expect guaranteed returns, but with proper funding, you'll be ready to catch the right opportunities.
